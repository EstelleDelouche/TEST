## Overview
The goal is to predict the lower half of a face given its upper half.

The first column of images shows true faces. The next columns illustrate how extremely randomized trees, k nearest neighbors, linear regression, Random Forest and ridge regression complete the lower half of those faces.

Code available on [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/miscellaneous/plot_multioutput_face_completion.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-miscellaneous-plot-multioutput-face-completion-py)
