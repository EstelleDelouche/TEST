abstract: Monitoring the evolution of groundwater resources is an issue for the twenty-first century. The expansion of agricultural land, urbanization and tourism are depleting aquifers. In this study, we propose to monitor groundwater reservoirs from the evolution of seismic wave velocity. The results obtained in Greece indicate that in several regions, the seismic wave velocity varies according to an annual cycle mainly controlled by aquifer loading and discharge. Hence by using continuous seismic noise records it is possible to track the evolution of aquifers over time and to distinguish shallow (∼100 m) from deep aquifers (∼1 km). Finally, we study the effect of water pumping from groundwater reservoirs. To that end, we combine GPS surface deformation measurements with seismic velocity variations. The results indicate that confined and unconfined aquifers respond differently. While for unconfined aquifers, pumping water implies an uplift of the surface, we show that for confined aquifers a subsidence occurs, due to the consolidation of the sediments at depth. While for unconfined aquifers, these surface variations are transient, the drainage of confined aquifers due to pumping is permanent.

Monitoring the evolution of groundwater resources is an issue for the twenty-first century. The expansion of agricultural land, urbanization and tourism are depleting aquifers. In this study, we propose to monitor groundwater reservoirs from the evolution of seismic wave velocity. The results obtained in Greece indicate that in several regions, the seismic wave velocity varies according to an annual cycle mainly controlled by aquifer loading and discharge. Hence, by using continuous seismic noise records it is possible to track the evolution of aquifers over time and to distinguish shallow (∼100 m) from deep aquifers (∼1 km).
